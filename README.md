# 🎨 CSS Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of **simple and fun CSS projects**!  
These are mini-experiments I built while practicing front-end development with **HTML**, **CSS**, and a little bit of **JavaScript**.

Each project lives in its own folder and can be opened directly in your browser.  
They're lightweight, responsive, and showcase different UI effects and animations.
